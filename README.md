As a programmer I use many virtual machines (VMs)
such as the JVM, V8, and YARV.
These VMs were built to abstract away the differences
between computer hardware and in many cases, operating
system details.

As a [resolution for the year 02018](https://twitter.com/habitmelon/status/950089834877497344), I committed to understanding the VMs I depend on. The first one I will
attempt to understand is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

http://vmgrok.xyz is the web app I built to visualize the
inner workings of the JVM. As I study other VMs, I will
add them to the site for everyone to see.

## to grok:
(_from wiktionary_)
Coined by Robert A. Heinlein in his novel Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) in which the word is described as being from the word for “to drink” and, figuratively, “to drink in all available aspects of reality”, “to become one with the observed” in Heinlein’s fictitious Martian language.

grok (third-person singular simple present groks, present participle grokking, simple past and past participle grokked)

 - (transitive, slang) To understand (something) intuitively.
 - To know (something) without having to think intellectually (such as knowing the number of objects in a collection without needing to count them: see subitize).

 - (transitive, slang) To fully and completely understand something in all of its details and intricacies.
  - I finally grok Perl.
  - I find it exceedingly doubtful that any person groks quantum mechanics.
